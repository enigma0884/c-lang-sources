# Programming in C

## What is C?
<p>
	C is a statically typed procedural programming language. It is the mother of all programming languages and is responsible for the existence of major technologies that we know today like the Windows, Linux and Mac operating system kernels, databases like MySQL and the python interpreter.

It was created by [Dennis Ritchie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie) in the year 1970 at Bell Labs while working on the UNIX operating system. It directly compiles to machine code and the executable **is platform dependent**.

## What is the purpose of this repository?
<p>
	This repo contains a quick reference to all the programs which were done in the classroom lectures and in the lab so that it would be easier for students to directly execute them on their own machines and play around with the code.
</p>

## How to access these files to execute on your own machine?
1. Make sure you have `git` installed. If not, you can refer to [this article](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/how-to-install-git-on-linux-mac-and-windows/).

2. Open up a terminal and clone this repo by executing
```
git clone https://github.com/enigma0884/c-lang-sources.git
```

3. Open up your favourite text editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and you should have access to the source code :)

## How to compile and run a C program?
You need to install a C compiler. You can use any compiler of your choice but I personally prefer and like using [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/). You can install GCC by referring to [this article](https://www.guru99.com/c-gcc-install.html).

After installing the compiler, run the following command from your terminal to compile your program to an executable
```
gcc <filename.c> -o [executable name]
```
by replacing `filename` with the name of the file you want to compile.
Note that the `-o` flag is provided to let our compiler know that our executable must be called by a specific name. This is optional but is highly recommended to keep executables distinct from each other.

Once that is done, a file ending with `.exe` is created which is your executable. After that, you can simply run this executable which will run the program!
